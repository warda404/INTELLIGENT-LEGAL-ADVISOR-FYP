Explanation 1: A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being movable property, is not the subject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as soon as it is served from the earth. Explanation 2: A moving effected by the same act which effects the severance may be a theft.

(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in 2's possession. It could not, therefore, be taken out of Z's possession, and A has not committed theft though he may have committed criminal breach of trust. (f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring in Z's possession, and if A dishonestly removes it. A commits theft.

(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the jeweller, any debt for which the jewellers might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Y's hand, and carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as what he did was not done dishonestly. (j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes the watch out of Z's possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as security for his debt. he commits theft, inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.

(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z's possession without Z's consent, with the intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration Here A takes dishonestly: A has. therefore, committed theft.

She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to her husband. Here it is probable that A may conceive that Z's wife is authorised to give away alms. If this was A's impression.
